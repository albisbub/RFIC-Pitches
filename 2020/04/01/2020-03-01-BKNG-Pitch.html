<h2 id="Reccomendation:">Reccomendation:<a class="anchor-link" href="#Reccomendation:"> </a></h2><p><em>We recommend a <strong>BUY</strong> on BKNG. We expect volatility to continue over the course of the next two weeks, therefore, we would like to use a tailored entry to capitalize on these movements. We propose placing a limit order for 3 shares of BKNG at $1000 per share. We would like to place a stop BUY at 1400 dollars per share. This means we would not buy BKNG unless it hit 1000 or 1300 dollars per share.</em></p>
<h2 id="Thesis">Thesis<a class="anchor-link" href="#Thesis"> </a></h2><p>Bookings is a quality company trading almost 50% off of 52-Week Highs. We believe that BKNG will be a winner coming out of this recession, and is currently attractive at these prices on a relative and DCF valuation basis. We think that BKNG's period of rapid revenue growth is coming to an end, however, after a large decline in revenues this year, we anticipate BKNG converging back to a steady 2% revenue growth rate over 10 years.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Why Now:</strong> The Coronavirus impacted and continues to impact the economy at an unprecedented level. Unlike the Great Depression, the Great Recession and other recessions, the Coronavirus upheaval has brought the global economy to a full halt. Economic indicators over the next few weeks will likely be some of the worst readings in the history on record. But under the presumption that the crises will eventually end, either by means of a vaccine or herd immunity, we decided to explore the wreckage that is the travel industry in search of pockets of value and mispriced names. Staying away from airlines, we turned to travel intermediaries and hospitality stocks and settled on a peer sample of companies who leverage technology.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Why Bookings:</strong> Bookings would compliment our portfolio as a multibillion dollar, global, US based technology company with many subsidiaries, including Booking.com, Priceline.com, Agoda.com, Kayak.com, Cheapflights, Rentalcars.com, Momondo, and OpenTable. They have a reputation of market dominance in hotel bookings. Additionally, Bookings aggressively expanded their operations using their fluency in information technology and hospitality to include restaurant reservations systems internationally. Bookings earnings have steadily increased in the past, and have room to continue as they expand.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Why Bookings now:</strong>  Models, incorporating worst case scenarios for economic slowdowns, predict not only Bookings’ survival as a company due to high margins, but also future growth. The consistent revenue they bring in as a vigorous company sustains the company through black swan events like the Coronavirus while maintaining positive outlooks for the future. As an online intermediary for travelers, hotels and restaurants, Bookings’s exposure is lower than other hospitality industries that had sold off recently, such as airlines, cruise lines, amusement parks, hotels, and food servicers. They have fewer employees and have the technological flexibility to afford periods of stagnation in development. BKNG is trading at historically cheap prices compared to fundamental value, and presents a significant opportunity to add a travel industry behemoth to our portfolio, and take advantage of the extreme pessimism and volatility equity markets are currently experiencing.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Brief-Industry-Overview">Brief Industry Overview<a class="anchor-link" href="#Brief-Industry-Overview"> </a></h2><p>Traveling requires planning trips and not too long ago consumers relied on travel agencies to serve that function. Technology changed the ease in which consumers can travel and plan their travels. With the rise of the internet and social media, consumers can access information, decide where they want to go and compare prices themselves. They also have more modes of transportation via ride sharing apps, greater volume and scope of airline flights in general improvements in global infrastructure. This increases demand for more travel, tourism and hospitality and, circularly, the industry’s newfound reliance on information technology. Every aspect of the everyday has been imbued with travel technology, and Bookings provides much of this information in one place, on any of their given websites. Travel technology demand by consumers and businesses rises along with new applications for travel technology. This demand is mainly satisfied by Bookings, the largest travel technology company in the world.</p>
<h2 id="Brief-Peer-Overview">Brief Peer Overview<a class="anchor-link" href="#Brief-Peer-Overview"> </a></h2><p>Bookings’ competitors include Expedia, Trip.com, and TripAdvisor. Expedia with a market cap of 8.8B includes CarRentals.com, Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Orbitz and Travelocity. Trip.com with a cap of 13.8B includes Airfarewatchdog, Bookingbuddy.com, Holidaylettings.co.uk, and Jetsetter.com. TripAdvisor, with a market cap of 2.4B receives a significant portion of their revenue from Bookings and Expedia. For comparison, Bookings has a market cap of $51.5B. Bookings outperforms its competitors in almost all performance markers.</p>
<h2 id="Business-Description">Business Description<a class="anchor-link" href="#Business-Description"> </a></h2><p>Booking Holdings Inc. provides online travel and related services in Europe, North America, South America, the Asia-Pacific region, the Middle East, and Africa. The company operates Booking.com, which connects travelers with a selection of places to stay, including apartments, vacation homes, family-run B&amp;Bs, 5-star luxury resorts, tree houses, and igloos; and KAYAK that searches other sites to show travelers the information they need to find the right flights, hotels, rental cars, and vacation packages. It also operates Priceline, an online travel deal service, which provides travelers to save on hotel rooms, airline tickets, rental cars, vacation packages, and cruises; Agoda, which provides online accommodation reservation services. In addition, the company operates Rentalcars.com that offers online rental car reservation services; and OpenTable, an online provider of restaurant reservation and information services to consumers and restaurant reservation management, as well as customer acquisition services to restaurants. Further, it offers travel insurance products. The company was formerly known as The Priceline Group Inc. and changed its name to Booking Holdings Inc. in February 2018. Booking Holdings Inc. was founded in 1997 and is headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut.(Source : Finviz)</p>
<h3 id="Revenue-Drivers">Revenue Drivers<a class="anchor-link" href="#Revenue-Drivers"> </a></h3><p>Agency, mechant and advertising operations drive Bookings’ revenue. Their main source of revenue comes from acting as an online travel agency booking hotels, car rentals and restaurant reservations with commissions. Their second source derives from their role as a merchant, selling reservations at hotels, car rentals and restaurant reservations. Bookings also receives revenue from traditional advertising on it’s websites.</p>
<h2 id="Sustainability-and-Governance">Sustainability and Governance<a class="anchor-link" href="#Sustainability-and-Governance"> </a></h2><p>Yahoo ESG rating is 19/100, quantified using data of 120 environmental, social and governance indicators including: carbon emissions, climate change effect, pollution, waste disposal, renewable energy, resource depletion, supply chain, political contributions, discrimination, diversity, community relations, human rights, cumulative voting, executive compensation, shareholders’ rights, takeover defense, staggered boards, and independent directors. ESG rating will penalize companies for “missing data.” A low score signals less risk in governance and social environmental impact. The anti-competitive nature of Bookings signals its success as a capitalist company as much as their disrespect for fair play in markets.Business informs Bookings political opinions, evidenced by their support for illegal Israeli occupation of Palestine.</p>
<h2 id="Risks">Risks<a class="anchor-link" href="#Risks"> </a></h2><p>The nice thing about this idea is the company is experiencing a worst case scenario. Economic activity will grind to a halt, and revenues will be impacted. We expect our revenues to decline modestly, and the DCF models account for this in the 60% decline in topline built into the first year.  One risk might be that recent events might change consumer behavior in the travel sector, and revenue streams might be dampened for the foreseeable future. Additionally, more than half of revenues are reservations and travel insurance, we could be too conservative, and large amounts of travel insurance claims might drain cash flows in ways our models do not anticipate.</p>
