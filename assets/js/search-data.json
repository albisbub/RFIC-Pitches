Recommendation: . We recommend a BUY on BKNG. We expect volatility to continue over the next two weeks; therefore, we would like to use a tailored entry to capitalize on these movements. We propose placing a limit order for three shares of BKNG at 1000 dollars per share. We want to place a stop BUY at 1400 dollars per share. For those who dont know what that means: we would not buy BKNG unless it hit 1000 or 1400 dollars per share. . Thesis . Bookings Holdings is a quality company trading almost 50% off of 52-Week Highs. We believe that BKNG wins coming out of this recession and currently attractive at these prices on a relative and DCF valuation basis. We think that BKNG&#39;s period of rapid revenue growth approaches an end, however, after a massive decline in revenues this year, we anticipate BKNG converging back to a steady 2% revenue growth rate over ten years. . Why Now: The Coronavirus impacted and continues to impact the economy at an unprecedented level. Unlike the Great Depression, the Great Recession and other recessions, the Coronavirus upheaval has brought the global economy to a full halt. Economic indicators over the next few weeks will likely be some of the worst readings in the history of US economic account records. But under the presumption that the crises will eventually end, either through a vaccine or herd immunity, we decided to explore the wreckage that is the travel industry in search of pockets of value and mispriced names. Staying away from airlines, we turned to travel intermediaries and hospitality stocks and settled on a peer sample of companies who leverage technology. . | Why Bookings: Bookings would complement our portfolio as a multibillion-dollar, global, US-based technology company with many subsidiaries, including Booking.com, Priceline.com, Agoda.com, Kayak.com, Cheapflights, Rentalcars.com, Momondo, and OpenTable. They have a reputation for market dominance in hotel bookings. Additionally, Bookings aggressively expanded their operations using their fluency in information technology and hospitality to include restaurant reservations systems internationally. Bookings earnings have steadily increased in the past, and have room to continue as they expand. . | Why Bookings now: Models, incorporating worst-case scenarios for economic slowdowns, predict not only Bookings&#39; survival as a company due to high margins, but also future growth. The consistent revenue they bring in as a dynamic company sustains the company through black swan events like the Coronavirus while maintaining positive outlooks for the future. As an online intermediary for travelers, hotels, and restaurants, Bookings&#39;s exposure is lower than other hospitality industries that had sold off recently, such as airlines, cruise lines, amusement parks, hotels, and food services. They have fewer employees and have the technological flexibility to afford periods of stagnation in development. BKNG is trading at historically low prices compared to fundamental value and presents a significant opportunity to add a travel industry behemoth to our portfolio and take advantage of the extreme pessimism, and volatility equity markets are currently experiencing. . | . Brief Industry Overview . Traveling requires planning trips; not too long ago, consumers relied on travel agencies to serve that function. Technology made that obsolete by allowing consumers to plan their travels. With the rise of the internet and social media, consumers can access information, decide where they want to go and compare prices themselves. They also have more modes of transportation via ride-sharing apps, higher volume, and scope of airline flights in general improvements in global infrastructure. . These technological advancements create more efficient markets for travelers and do most of the heavy lifting when it comes to contract matching and sales. It is no wonder that Tourism, hospitality, and circularly, industries have newfound reliance on information technology. . Bookings provide much of this information in one place, on any of their given websites. Travel technology demand by consumers and businesses rises along with new applications for travel technology. This demand is mainly satisfied with Bookings, the largest travel technology company in the world. . Brief Peer Overview . Bookings&#39; competitors include Expedia, Trip.com, and TripAdvisor. Expedia with a market cap of 8.8B includes CarRentals.com, Expedia.com, Hotels.com, Orbitz and Travelocity. Trip.com with a cap of 13.8B includes Airfarewatchdog, Bookingbuddy.com, Holidaylettings.co.uk, and Jetsetter.com. TripAdvisor, with a market cap of 2.4B receives a significant portion of their revenue from Bookings and Expedia. For comparison, Bookings has a market cap of $51.5B. Bookings outperforms its competitors in almost all performance markers. . Business Description . Booking Holdings Inc. provides online travel and related services in Europe, North America, South America, the Asia-Pacific region, the Middle East, and Africa. The company operates Booking.com, which connects travelers with a selection of places to stay, including apartments, vacation homes, family-run B&amp;Bs, 5-star luxury resorts, tree houses, and igloos; and KAYAK that searches other sites to show travelers the information they need to find the right flights, hotels, rental cars, and vacation packages. It also operates Priceline, an online travel deal service, which provides travelers to save on hotel rooms, airline tickets, rental cars, vacation packages, and cruises; Agoda, which provides online accommodation reservation services. In addition, the company operates Rentalcars.com that offers online rental car reservation services; and OpenTable, an online provider of restaurant reservation and information services to consumers and restaurant reservation management, as well as customer acquisition services to restaurants. Further, it offers travel insurance products. The company was formerly known as The Priceline Group Inc. and changed its name to Booking Holdings Inc. in February 2018. Booking Holdings Inc. was founded in 1997 and is headquartered in Norwalk, Connecticut. (Source: Finviz) . Revenue Drivers . Agency, merchant and advertising operations drive Bookings&#39; revenue. Their main source of revenue comes from acting as an online travel agency booking hotels, car rentals and restaurant reservations with commissions. Their second source derives from their role as a merchant, selling reservations at hotels, car rentals and restaurant reservations. Bookings also receives revenue from traditional advertising on it&#39;s websites. . Sustainability and Governance . Yahoo ESG rating is 19/100, quantified using data of 120 environmental, social and governance indicators including: carbon emissions, climate change effect, pollution, waste disposal, renewable energy, resource depletion, supply chain, political contributions, discrimination, diversity, community relations, human rights, cumulative voting, executive compensation, shareholders&#39; rights, takeover defense, staggered boards, and independent directors. ESG rating will penalize companies for &quot;missing data.&quot; A low score signals less risk in governance and social-environmental impact. The anti-competitive nature of Bookings indicates its success as a capitalist company as much as their disrespect for fair play in markets. Business informs Bookings political opinions, evidenced by their support for the illegal Israeli occupation of Palestine. . Risks . The beautiful thing about this idea is the company is experiencing a worst-case scenario. Economic activity will grind to a halt, and revenues will be impacted. We expect BKNG&#39;s revenues to decline modestly, and the DCF models account for this in the 60% decline in topline built into the first year. One risk might be that recent events might change consumer behavior in the travel sector, and revenue streams might be dampened for the foreseeable future. Additionally, more than half of revenues are reservations and travel insurance--massive amounts of travel insurance claims might drain cash flows in ways our models do not anticipate. .",
